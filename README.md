# Control Logic Generation Prompts
This repository contains a collection of natural language prompts to generate control logic in [IEC 61131-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_61131-3) [Structured Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_text) using [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) (LLM). The collection is structured in categories:
- Standard Algorithms
- Mathematical Functions
- PLC Programming Tasks
- Process Control
- Sequential Control
- Interlocks
- Diagnostics / Communication
- Advanced Process Control
- Various Engineering Inputs
- Programmer Support

For testing the capabilities of LLMs to generate source code in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text notation, we have fed the prompts to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) with the [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) LLM, and saved the generated answers.
