> Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program, not a function block, to implement feedforward control for adjusting the speed of a conveyor belt based on sensor-based predicted load.

In this self-contained IEC 61131-3 structured text program, we will implement feedforward control to adjust the speed of a conveyor belt based on the sensor-based predicted load. The program will use a PID controller to maintain the desired speed setpoint.

END_PROGRAM

This program defines a conveyor belt control system that uses a PID controller to maintain the desired speed setpoint and adjusts it based on the predicted load using feedforward control. The `RunConveyorControl` method is responsible for calculating the PID terms, feedforward control, and applying the control signal to the conveyor belt system. The `SetConveyorSpeed` method should be replaced with the actual conveyor control system to adjust the conveyor belt speed based on the calculated control signal.
