> Create an ISA-88 batch control recipe for adhesive production.

ISA-88 (also known as S88) is a standard for batch process control, providing a consistent structure for designing and implementing batch control systems. The following is an example of an ISA-88 batch control recipe for adhesive production.

1.  Recipe Overview: Name: Adhesive Production Recipe Version: 1.0 Date: 2023-03-19 Description: This recipe outlines the production process of a general-purpose adhesive using a set of ISA-88 compliant phases and equipment modules.
    
2.  Recipe Phases: A. Raw Material Preparation B. Mixing and Reaction C. Cooling and Filtering D. Packaging
    
3.  Recipe Procedure:
    

A. Raw Material Preparation: A.1. Weighing and transferring raw materials: - Equipments: Weighing scale, Transfer pump - Procedure: 1. Weigh and record the following raw materials: - Resin (e.g., epoxy, polyurethane, or acrylic): X kg - Hardener (e.g., amine, isocyanate, or anhydride): Y kg - Filler (e.g., silica or clay): Z kg 2. Transfer each raw material to the designated mixing tank.

B. Mixing and Reaction: B.1. Pre-mixing: - Equipments: Mixing tank, Agitator - Procedure: 1. Start the agitator and mix the resin and hardener at a predefined speed for T1 minutes. 2. Add the filler to the mixture and continue mixing for T2 minutes.

B.2. Reaction: - Equipments: Mixing tank, Agitator, Temperature sensor, Heating jacket - Procedure: 1. Monitor the temperature and ensure that it is within the specified range (Tmin - Tmax °C). 2. If needed, use the heating jacket to adjust the temperature. 3. Continue the mixing and reaction process for T3 minutes or until the desired viscosity is reached.

C. Cooling and Filtering: C.1. Cooling: - Equipments: Mixing tank, Cooling jacket, Temperature sensor - Procedure: 1. Activate the cooling jacket to bring down the temperature of the adhesive mixture to T4 °C. 2. Monitor the temperature and maintain it within the specified range.

C.2. Filtering: - Equipments: Filter, Transfer pump - Procedure: 1. Transfer the adhesive mixture through the filter to remove any undissolved particles or impurities.

D. Packaging: D.1. Filling and sealing: - Equipments: Filling machine, Sealing machine, Conveyor system - Procedure: 1. Fill the adhesive into the designated containers (e.g., tubes, cartridges, or bottles). 2. Seal the containers using the sealing machine. 3. Label the containers with the necessary product information (e.g., product name, batch number, date of manufacture, and expiry date).

4.  Quality Control: Perform quality control checks at various stages of the process, including raw material inspection, in-process checks, and final product testing. Ensure the adhesive meets the required specifications for viscosity, adhesion, curing time, and other relevant parameters.
    
5.  Safety and Environmental Considerations: Follow safety guidelines and wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the process. Dispose of any waste or by-products according to local regulations and industry best practices.
    

Note: This is a simplified example of an adhesive production recipe based on the ISA-88 standard. It is essential to adjust the recipe parameters (e.g., raw material quantities, temperatures, mixing times)

> Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program for the sequential control in step B.2 Reaction. Include concrete process parameters and timers.

The following is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program for the sequential control in step B.2 Reaction. Concrete process parameters and timers are included.

iecst

```iecst
PROGRAM ReactionPhaseControl
VAR
    // Inputs
    ActualTemperature: REAL; // Input from the temperature sensor (°C)

    // Outputs
    HeaterControl: BOOL; // Output to control the heating jacket
    AgitatorControl: BOOL; // Output to control the agitator

    // Parameters
    CONST Tmin: REAL := 60.0; // Minimum temperature for the reaction (°C)
    CONST Tmax: REAL := 80.0; // Maximum temperature for the reaction (°C)
    CONST ReactionTime: TIME := T#30m; // Reaction time (30 minutes)

    // Internal variables
    ReactionTimer: TON; // Timer for the reaction phase
    ReactionPhaseInProgress: BOOL := FALSE;
    ReactionPhaseCompleted: BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

METHOD StartReactionPhase: BOOL
    ReactionPhaseInProgress := TRUE;
    ReactionTimer(IN:= ReactionPhaseInProgress);
    ReactionPhaseCompleted := FALSE;
    RETURN ReactionPhaseInProgress;
END_METHOD

METHOD StopReactionPhase: BOOL
    ReactionPhaseInProgress := FALSE;
    ReactionTimer(IN:= ReactionPhaseInProgress);
    ReactionPhaseCompleted := TRUE;
    RETURN ReactionPhaseCompleted;
END_METHOD

METHOD CheckReactionPhaseComplete: BOOL
    RETURN ReactionPhaseCompleted;
END_METHOD

METHOD ReactionPhaseLogic
    // Control the agitator
    IF ReactionPhaseInProgress THEN
        AgitatorControl := TRUE;
    ELSE
        AgitatorControl := FALSE;
    END_IF;

    // Monitor and control the temperature
    IF ActualTemperature < Tmin THEN
        HeaterControl := TRUE;
    ELSIF ActualTemperature > Tmax THEN
        HeaterControl := FALSE;
    END_IF;

    // Check if the reaction timer has expired
    IF ReactionTimer.Q AND ReactionPhaseInProgress THEN
        StopReactionPhase();
    END_IF;
END_METHOD
END_PROGRAM
```

This Structured Text program includes a `PROGRAM` block for the reaction phase control, with input and output variables, parameters, and internal variables. It uses `METHOD` blocks for starting and stopping the reaction phase, checking if the reaction phase is complete, and implementing the reaction phase logic. The program continuously monitors the temperature and controls the heating jacket and agitator. The reaction phase is considered complete when the reaction timer expires.

> Add the control logic that actually calls these methods.

To call the methods defined in the ReactionPhaseControl program, we need to create another program (e.g., MainProgram) that manages the overall process flow and execution. Here is an example of how to use the methods in a main program:

iecst

```iecst
PROGRAM MainProgram
VAR
    // Instance of the ReactionPhaseControl program
    ReactionControl: ReactionPhaseControl;

    // Process control variables
    StartProcess: BOOL := FALSE;
    ProcessCompleted: BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

// Main control logic
CASE StartProcess OF
    // Start process
    TRUE:
        IF NOT ReactionControl.CheckReactionPhaseComplete() THEN
            ReactionControl.StartReactionPhase();
            ReactionControl.ReactionPhaseLogic();
        ELSE
            ProcessCompleted := TRUE;
        END_IF;

    // Stop process
    FALSE:
        IF ReactionControl.ReactionPhaseInProgress THEN
            ReactionControl.StopReactionPhase();
        END_IF;
        ProcessCompleted := FALSE;
END_CASE
```

In this example, MainProgram creates an instance of the ReactionPhaseControl program and uses StartProcess to control the overall process flow. When StartProcess is TRUE, the program checks whether the reaction phase is complete. If it is not complete, the StartReactionPhase() method is called, followed by the ReactionPhaseLogic() method. If the reaction phase is complete, ProcessCompleted is set to TRUE. If StartProcess is FALSE, the StopReactionPhase() method is called, and ProcessCompleted is set to FALSE.
