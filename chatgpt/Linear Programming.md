> Write a self-contained function block in 61131-3 for linear programming.

IEC 61131-3 is an international standard for PLC programming languages. This standard defines several languages, including Ladder Diagram (LD), Structured Text (ST), Function Block Diagram (FBD), Sequential Function Chart (SFC), and Instruction List (IL). Since you didn't specify which language to use, I'll provide an example in Structured Text (ST), which is a popular choice for complex logic.

The function block I provide here is a simple implementation of the Simplex algorithm for linear programming. The algorithm is designed for solving linear programming problems in the form:

maximize: c^T \* x subject to: A \* x <= b and x >= 0

Please note that this implementation is quite simple and might not cover all edge cases, nor is it optimized for large-scale problems. For more advanced use cases, consider using specialized libraries or dedicated optimization tools.

Here's the function block in Structured Text:

typescript

```typescript
This `LinearProgramming` function block takes `A`, `b`, and `c` as inputs, which represent the coefficients of the linear constraints and the objective function, respectively. The block outputs the solution vector `x` and the optimal value of the objective function. The `Solve` method within the function block performs the Simplex algorithm and returns a boolean value indicating whether a solution was successfully found or not.

To use this function block, create an instance of the `LinearProgramming` block, set the input parameters, call the `Solve` method, and retrieve the results from the output variables. Note that the array sizes need to be adjusted according to the problem size.
