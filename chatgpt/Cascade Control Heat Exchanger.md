> Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program, not a function block, to implement cascade control for the temperature in a heat exchanger.

Below is a simple structured text program implementing a cascade control strategy for temperature control in a heat exchanger using IEC 61131-3 standard. This program assumes you have two analog inputs for the temperature sensors (PV1 and PV2), two analog outputs for the control valves (CV1 and CV2), and a setpoint (SP) for the desired temperature.

PROGRAM CascadeControl
VAR
    PV1, PV2 : REAL; // Process variable temperatures from the sensors
    CV1, CV2 : REAL; // Control variable outputs for the control valves
    SP : REAL; // Setpoint for the desired temperature
    Kp1, Kp2 : REAL := 1; // Proportional gains for the primary and secondary controllers
    Ti1, Ti2 : REAL := 100; // Integral time constants for the primary and secondary controllers
    Td1, Td2 : REAL := 0; // Derivative time constants for the primary and secondary controllers
    dt : TIME := t#500ms; // Sampling time
    e1, e2 : REAL; // Errors for the primary and secondary controllers
    sum_e1, sum_e2 : REAL; // Sum of the errors for the primary and secondary controllers
    prev_e1, prev_e2 : REAL; // Previous errors for the primary and secondary controllers
    u1, u2 : REAL; // Control actions for the primary and secondary controllers
END_VAR

// Cascade control loop
METHOD CascadeControlLoop
    e1 := SP - PV1; // Error calculation for primary controller
    e2 := u1 - PV2; // Error calculation for secondary controller

    // Calculate control actions for the primary and secondary controllers
    u1 := Kp1 * e1 + (Kp1 / Ti1) * sum_e1 * dt - Kp1 * Td1 * (e1 - prev_e1) / dt;
    u2 := Kp2 * e2 + (Kp2 / Ti2) * sum_e2 * dt - Kp2 * Td2 * (e2 - prev_e2) / dt;

    // Update the control valves
    CV1 := LIMIT(0, u1, 100); // Limit the control valve output to 0-100%
    CV2 := LIMIT(0, u2, 100); // Limit the control valve output to 0-100%

    // Update the previous error values and sum of the errors
    prev_e1 := e1;
    prev_e2 := e2;
    sum_e1 := sum_e1 + e1;
    sum_e2 := sum_e2 + e2;
END_METHOD

// Main program execution

This program implements a simple PI (Proportional-Integral) cascade control strategy. You can adjust the proportional gain (Kp) and integral time constant (Ti) for both primary and secondary controllers as needed. Note that this program does not include any communication or I/O handling. You will need to integrate it with your specific PLC or control system accordingly.
