There is an error in the timer configuration. The timer `PT` (preset time) parameter is not set in some cases, which can lead to unexpected behavior. To fix this, you should set the `PT` parameter in all timer calls. For example, you can set the yellow light duration to `T#3s`:

iecst

    ```iecst
// Turn on yellow light for warning and start the timer
    yellowLightOn := TRUE;
    redLightOn := FALSE;
    timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching, PT := T#3s); // Set the PT parameter

    ...
    
    // Check the timer and switch to the next light if it's time
    IF timer.Q THEN
        IF greenLightOn THEN
            greenLightOn := FALSE;
            yellowLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching, PT := T#3s); // Set the PT parameter

        ELSEIF yellowLightOn THEN
            yellowLightOn := FALSE;
            redLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := FALSE);

        ELSE // red light is on
            redLightOn := FALSE;
            greenLightOn := TRUE;
            timer(IN := NOT emergencyVehicleApproaching, PT := T#5s); // Set the PT parameter
        END_IF;
    END_IF;
```

Now the timer will work correctly, switching the yellow light after 3 seconds and the green light after 5 seconds.

> Are there any other errors or issues in the code?

I found another issue with the code. In the pedestrian crossing section, the code currently waits for the pedestrian button to be unpressed (released) before switching to the yellow light. This might not work as intended, as pedestrians may still be crossing when the button is released.

To fix this, you can introduce a fixed time delay for the pedestrian crossing, instead of waiting for the button to be unpressed. You can use a timer for this purpose. I will add a pedestrian crossing timer (`pedestrianCrossingTimer`) and set its preset time to 10 seconds (`T#10s`):

iecst

```iecst
VAR
    ...
    pedestrianCrossingTimer: TON; // timer for pedestrian crossing
END_VAR

// Initialize the program
...
pedestrianCrossingTimer(IN := FALSE, PT := T#10s);

WHILE TRUE DO
    ...
    ELSEIF pedestrianButtonPressed THEN
        ...
        // Wait for pedestrian to cross
        pedestrianCrossingTimer(IN := TRUE);
        WAIT UNTIL pedestrianCrossingTimer.Q;
        pedestrianCrossingTimer(IN := FALSE);
        
        // Turn on yellow light for warning and start the timer
        ...
    ...
END_WHILE
```

With these changes, the traffic light will wait for 10 seconds after the pedestrian button is pressed, allowing sufficient time for pedestrians to cross before switching to the yellow light.
