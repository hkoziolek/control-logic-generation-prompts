> Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text function block to act as a Modbus server. It shall process up to 10 parallel client connection requests by Modbus TCP. Modbus requests work within data ranges that map the input and holding registers. The following Modbus function codes are supported: 0x01 Read Coils 0x02 Read Discrete Inputs 0x03 Read Holding Registers 0x04 Read Input Registers 0x05 Write Single Coil 0x06 Write Single Register 0x0F Write Multiple Coils 0x10 Write Multiple Registers 0x17 Read/Write Multiple Registers

To implement a Modbus server as a self-contained IEC 61131-3 structured text function block, you can use the following code. This example assumes that you have access to a Modbus TCP library compatible with IEC 61131-3. Please note that this is a simple implementation and may need to be adapted for your specific use case.

iecst

```iecst
FUNCTION_BLOCK ModbusServer
VAR_INPUT
    Enable: BOOL; (* Enable or Disable the Modbus Server *)
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
    ServerStatus: BOOL; (* Indicates if the server is running *)
    Error: STRING; (* Error message in case of a failure *)
END_VAR

VAR
    ModbusTCP: ModbusTCP_Server;
    Connection: ARRAY[1..10] OF ModbusTCP_Connection;
    Request: ModbusTCP_Request;
    Data: ModbusTCP_Data;
    i: INT;
END_VAR

METHOD HandleRequest: BOOL
VAR_INPUT
    Request: ModbusTCP_Request;
    Data: ModbusTCP_Data;
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Success: BOOL;
END_VAR
BEGIN
    CASE Request.FunctionCode OF
        1: Success := Data.ReadCoils(Request.Address, Request.Quantity);
        2: Success := Data.ReadDiscreteInputs(Request.Address, Request.Quantity);
        3: Success := Data.ReadHoldingRegisters(Request.Address, Request.Quantity);
        4: Success := Data.ReadInputRegisters(Request.Address, Request.Quantity);
        5: Success := Data.WriteSingleCoil(Request.Address, Request.Value);
        6: Success := Data.WriteSingleRegister(Request.Address, Request.Value);
        15: Success := Data.WriteMultipleCoils(Request.Address, Request.Quantity, Request.Values);
        16: Success := Data.WriteMultipleRegisters(Request.Address, Request.Quantity, Request.Values);
        23: Success := Data.ReadWriteMultipleRegisters(Request.Address, Request.Quantity, Request.Values);
        ELSE
            Success := FALSE;
    END_CASE;
END_METHOD

METHOD RunServer
BEGIN
    IF Enable THEN
        ServerStatus := ModbusTCP.StartServer(502);

        IF ServerStatus THEN
            FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO
                Connection[i].Accept(ModbusTCP);

                IF Connection[i].IsConnected THEN
                    Connection[i].ProcessRequest(Request);

                    IF Request.IsValid THEN
                        HandleRequest(Request, Data);
                        Connection[i].SendResponse(Request);
                    END_IF;
                END_IF;
            END_FOR;
        ELSE
            Error := 'Failed to start the Modbus server.';
        END_IF;
    ELSE
        ModbusTCP.StopServer();
        ServerStatus := FALSE;
    END_IF;
END_METHOD
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK
```

To use this function block in your PLC program, create an instance of the ModbusServer block and call the RunServer method in your cyclic task or program. Remember to configure the Modbus TCP library and data ranges according to your specific requirements.

> Provide the content of the ReadCoils method.

The ReadCoils method reads the status of coils (digital outputs) from the Modbus data model. This method can be implemented as follows:

iecst

```iecst
METHOD ReadCoils: BOOL
VAR_INPUT
    StartAddress: UINT; (* Starting address of the coils *)
    Quantity: UINT;     (* Number of coils to read *)
END_VAR
VAR_OUTPUT
    Success: BOOL;      (* Indicates if the operation was successful *)
END_VAR
VAR
    i: UINT;
    CoilValue: BOOL;
END_VAR
BEGIN
    Success := FALSE;

    IF (Quantity > 0) AND (Quantity <= 2000) THEN
        FOR i := StartAddress TO StartAddress + Quantity - 1 DO
            CoilValue := ReadCoil(i);

            IF NOT CoilValue THEN
                RETURN; (* Return if there is any error while reading a coil *)
            END_IF;

            Request.ResponseData[i - StartAddress] := BOOL_TO_BYTE(CoilValue);
        END_FOR;

        Success := TRUE;
    END_IF;
END_METHOD
```

This method reads the specified number of coils starting from the given address. The BOOL\_TO\_BYTE function is used to convert the boolean coil values into bytes that can be stored in the response data. The ReadCoil method should be implemented separately, which reads the coil value at the specified address. This method is specific to your data model and must be adapted to your use case.

Note that the maximum number of coils that can be read in one request is 2000. Ensure that the address and quantity are within the valid range for your specific application.
