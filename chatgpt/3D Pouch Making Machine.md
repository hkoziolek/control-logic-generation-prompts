> A 3D pouch making machine has 8 heating and 8 cooling station. It has one horizontal and one vertical cutter at the end of the machine. The machine has two feeder units to feed raw material where winding tension is very important to maintain on order to keep proper tension in the raw material through out the machine. Create a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for this machine and formulate it as IEC 61131-3 Structured Text.

In order to create a detailed start-up and shutdown sequence for the 3D pouch making machine using IEC 61131-3 Structured Text (ST) programming, we'll follow these steps:

1.  Initialize the machine.
2.  Start the heating and cooling stations.
3.  Start the feeders and maintain winding tension.
4.  Start the horizontal and vertical cutters.
5.  Stop the horizontal and vertical cutters.
6.  Stop the feeders.
7.  Stop the heating and cooling stations.
8.  Shutdown the machine.

Here is the sample ST code for the sequence:

objectivec

```objectivec
PROGRAM PouchMachine
VAR
    start_machine: BOOL := FALSE;
    stop_machine: BOOL := FALSE;
    machine_ready: BOOL := FALSE;
    feeder_running: BOOL := FALSE;
    cutter_running: BOOL := FALSE;
    heating_running: BOOL := FALSE;
    cooling_running: BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

METHOD StartUpSequence: BOOL
    machine_ready := TRUE;
    
    // Start heating and cooling stations
    heating_running := TRUE;
    cooling_running := TRUE;
    
    // Start feeders and maintain winding tension
    feeder_running := TRUE;
    
    // Start horizontal and vertical cutters
    cutter_running := TRUE;
    
    RETURN machine_ready;
END_METHOD

METHOD ShutDownSequence: BOOL
    // Stop horizontal and vertical cutters
    cutter_running := FALSE;
    
    // Stop feeders
    feeder_running := FALSE;
    
    // Stop heating and cooling stations
    heating_running := FALSE;
    cooling_running := FALSE;
    
    machine_ready := FALSE;
    
    RETURN machine_ready;
END_METHOD

// Main Program
IF start_machine THEN
    StartUpSequence();
ELSIF stop_machine THEN
    ShutDownSequence();
END_IF
END_PROGRAM
```

This ST code provides a simple start-up and shutdown sequence for the 3D pouch making machine. Note that in a real-world application, you would also need to include error handling, interlocks, and other safety measures, as well as handling various sensors, actuators, and other specific machine components. The code would also need to be integrated with the appropriate PLC and HMI systems for proper operation.
