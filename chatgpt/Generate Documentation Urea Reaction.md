UreaReactionControl Developer Documentation
===========================================

Overview
--------

The UreaReactionControl program is responsible for controlling a urea production process. The process consists of loading raw materials (ammonia and CO2), monitoring and adjusting the reaction conditions (pressure and temperature), and stopping the process once the reaction is complete.

Variables
---------

### Inputs

*   `stAmmoniaValve`: BOOL - Indicates the status of the ammonia valve (TRUE when open, FALSE when closed).
*   `stCO2Valve`: BOOL - Indicates the status of the CO2 valve (TRUE when open, FALSE when closed).
*   `rCurrentPressure`: REAL - The current reactor pressure in bars.
*   `rCurrentTemperature`: REAL - The current reactor temperature in degrees Celsius.

### Outputs

*   `stAmmoniaValveControl`: BOOL - Command to open (TRUE) or close (FALSE) the ammonia valve.
*   `stCO2ValveControl`: BOOL - Command to open (TRUE) or close (FALSE) the CO2 valve.

### Internal Variables

*   `stStep1`: BOOL - Step 1 flag (Load raw materials) which is set to TRUE when both raw materials are loaded.
*   `stStep2`: BOOL - Step 2 flag (Control reaction) which is set to TRUE when the reaction is complete.
*   `stReactionFinished`: BOOL - Reaction finished flag, set to TRUE when the reaction process is completed.

### Parameters

*   `rTargetPressure`: REAL - The target reactor pressure in bars (default: 175.0).
*   `rPressureTolerance`: REAL - The pressure tolerance in bars (default: 5.0).
*   `rTargetTemperature`: REAL - The target reactor temperature in degrees Celsius (default: 185.0).
*   `rTemperatureTolerance`: REAL - The temperature tolerance in degrees Celsius (default: 2.0).
*   `tReactionTime`: TIME - The total reaction time (default: 30 minutes).
*   `tReactionTimer`: TIME - A timer to track the reaction time.

Main Sequence
-------------

1.  If the reaction is not finished (`stReactionFinished` is FALSE), proceed with the following steps: a. **Step 1 (Load raw materials):** If `stStep1` is FALSE, open both ammonia and CO2 valves by setting `stAmmoniaValveControl` and `stCO2ValveControl` to TRUE. When both valves are open, set `stStep1` to TRUE and start the reaction timer by assigning the `CURRENT_TIME` to `tReactionTimer`. b. **Step 2 (Control reaction):** If `stStep1` is TRUE and `stStep2` is FALSE, check if the current pressure and temperature are within the specified tolerance range. If the conditions are within the range and the reaction time has elapsed, set `stStep2` to TRUE. If the conditions are not within the specified range, adjust the valves based on the current pressure and temperature.
2.  If the reaction is finished (`stStep2` is TRUE), close both ammonia and CO2 valves by setting `stAmmoniaValveControl` and `stCO2ValveControl` to FALSE, and set `stReactionFinished` to TRUE.

Detailed Sequence
-----------------

### Step 1: Load raw materials

1.  Check if `stStep1` is FALSE.
2.  If `stStep1` is FALSE, perform the following: a. Set `stAmmoniaValveControl` and `stCO2ValveControl` to TRUE to open both valves. b. Check if both `stAmmoniaValve` and `stCO2Valve` are TRUE. c. If both valves are open, set `stStep1` to TRUE and initialize the `tReactionTimer` by assigning the `CURRENT_TIME` to it.

### Step 2: Control reaction

1.  Check if `stStep1` is TRUE and `stStep2` is FALSE.
2.  If both conditions are met, perform the following: a. Check if the current pressure (`rCurrentPressure`) and temperature (`rCurrentTemperature`) are within the target pressure and temperature ranges (considering the specified tolerances). b. If the conditions are within the specified ranges, check if the `CURRENT_TIME` is greater than or equal to the `tReactionTimer` plus `tReactionTime`. c. If the current time exceeds the `tReactionTimer` plus `tReactionTime`, set `stStep2` to TRUE, indicating that the reaction is complete. d. If the current pressure and temperature are not within the specified ranges, adjust the ammonia and CO2 valves based on the current pressure and temperature by setting `stAmmoniaValveControl` and `stCO2ValveControl`.

### Step 3: Finish reaction

1.  Check if `stStep2` is TRUE.
2.  If `stStep2` is TRUE, perform the following: a. Set `stAmmoniaValveControl` and `stCO2ValveControl` to FALSE to close both valves. b. Set `stReactionFinished` to TRUE, indicating that the reaction process is completed.

Use Cases
---------

### Adjusting Parameters

You can adjust the parameters for the target pressure, pressure tolerance, target temperature, and temperature tolerance to modify the reaction conditions. This flexibility allows you to optimize the process based on the specific urea production requirements.

### Monitoring Reaction Progress

By monitoring the `stStep1`, `stStep2`, and `stReactionFinished` variables, you can track the progress of the urea production process. This information can be used for process visualization or to trigger additional control logic in your automation system.

### Ensuring Safe Operation

The program ensures that the reaction conditions are maintained within the specified pressure and temperature tolerances. This helps to ensure safe operation and prevent equipment damage due to excessive pressure or temperature during the urea production process.
