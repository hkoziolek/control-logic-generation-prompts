> Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program, not a function block, to implement feedforward control for mixing two reactants.

Here is a self-contained IEC 61131-3 Structured Text program that implements feedforward control for mixing two reactants. The program assumes that you have two input flow rates (FlowRate1 and FlowRate2) and the desired mixing ratio (MixRatio). The program calculates the output flow rates for the two reactants (OutFlowRate1 and OutFlowRate2) to maintain the desired mixing ratio.

```iecst
PROGRAM FeedForwardControl
VAR
    FlowRate1, FlowRate2: REAL; // Input flow rates of reactants
    MixRatio: REAL; // Desired mixing ratio (Reactant1:Reactant2)
    OutFlowRate1, OutFlowRate2: REAL; // Output flow rates for reactants to maintain the mixing ratio
    MixedFlowRate: REAL; // Total mixed flow rate
    MinFlow, MaxFlow: REAL; // Minimum and maximum possible flow rates
END_VAR

// Constants
MinFlow := 0.0;
MaxFlow := 100.0;

// Ensure the input flow rates are within the allowed range
IF FlowRate1 < MinFlow THEN
    FlowRate1 := MinFlow;
ELSIF FlowRate1 > MaxFlow THEN
    FlowRate1 := MaxFlow;
END_IF;

IF FlowRate2 < MinFlow THEN
    FlowRate2 := MinFlow;
ELSIF FlowRate2 > MaxFlow THEN
    FlowRate2 := MaxFlow;
END_IF;

// Calculate the total mixed flow rate
MixedFlowRate := FlowRate1 + FlowRate2;

// Calculate the output flow rates for the reactants to maintain the mixing ratio
OutFlowRate1 := MixedFlowRate * MixRatio / (MixRatio + 1);
OutFlowRate2 := MixedFlowRate * 1 / (MixRatio + 1);

// Ensure the output flow rates are within the allowed range
IF OutFlowRate1 < MinFlow THEN
    OutFlowRate1 := MinFlow;
ELSIF OutFlowRate1 > MaxFlow THEN
    OutFlowRate1 := MaxFlow;
END_IF;

IF OutFlowRate2 < MinFlow THEN
    OutFlowRate2 := MinFlow;
ELSIF OutFlowRate2 > MaxFlow THEN
    OutFlowRate2 := MaxFlow;
END_IF;

END_PROGRAM
```

This program can be customized according to specific hardware configurations or additional requirements. The program takes the input flow rates of the two reactants and calculates the output flow rates needed to maintain the desired mixing ratio while ensuring the flow rates are within the allowed minimum and maximum limits.
