Model: GPT-4

> Write a non-linear model-predictive controller in Python that optimizes the startup of a steam generator in a power plant.

Designing a non-linear model-predictive controller (NMPC) for a steam generator in a power plant requires expertise in control theory, power plant operations, and deep knowledge of the specific system dynamics. However, I can provide you with a high-level example that you can adapt and refine to suit your specific needs.

Please note that this example is a simplified version, and you should consult with control engineers and power plant experts to implement a real-world NMPC for a steam generator.

1.  First, we'll define the steam generator model. In this example, we use a simple first-order non-linear model:

python

```python
import numpy as np

def steam_generator_model(x, u, params):
    # x: state variables (e.g., temperature, pressure)
    # u: control inputs (e.g., fuel flow rate, coolant flow rate)
    # params: model parameters (e.g., heat capacity, time constants)

    # Implement the non-linear model equations here, for example:
    dxdt = -params['alpha'] * x[0] * np.exp(-params['beta'] * x[1]) + params['gamma'] * u[0] * u[1]

    return dxdt
```

2.  Next, we'll implement the cost function that the NMPC will optimize:

python

```python
def cost_function(x, u, setpoints, params):
    # x: state variables
    # u: control inputs
    # setpoints: desired state values (e.g., target temperature and pressure)
    # params: cost function parameters (e.g., weights for different objectives)

    # Define the cost, e.g., weighted sum of squared errors
    cost = params['weight_x'] * (x[0] - setpoints[0])**2 + params['weight_u'] * u[0]**2

    return cost
```

3.  Now we'll implement the NMPC optimization using a suitable optimization library, like SciPy:

python

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize

def nmpc_optimization(x, u_init, setpoints, params, horizon):
    # x: current state variables
    # u_init: initial control inputs for optimization
    # setpoints: desired state values
    # params: model and cost function parameters
    # horizon: prediction horizon for NMPC

    def objective(u):
        cost = 0
        x_pred = x.copy()

        # Loop through the prediction horizon
        for i in range(horizon):
            # Apply the control input and update the state
            x_pred += steam_generator_model(x_pred, u[i], params)

            # Accumulate the cost
            cost += cost_function(x_pred, u[i], setpoints, params)

        return cost

    # Optimize the control inputs
    result = minimize(objective, u_init, method='SLSQP')

    return result.x
```

4.  Finally, create a loop that simulates the steam generator startup:

python

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define parameters, initial conditions, and setpoints
params = {'alpha': 0.1, 'beta': 0.2, 'gamma': 0.3,
          'weight_x': 1, 'weight_u': 0.01}
x_init = np.array([0.0])
u_init = np.array([1.0])
setpoints = np.array([1.0])
horizon = 20

# Simulation settings
simulation_time = 100
sampling_time = 1

# Initialize variables
x = x_init.copy()
x_history = [x_init]

# Simulation loop
for t in range(simulation_time):
    u_opt = nmpc_optimization
```

> continue

(x, u\_init, setpoints, params, horizon)

makefile

```makefile
# Apply the first optimized control input to the system
x += steam_generator_model(x, u_opt[0], params) * sampling_time

# Store the state for visualization
x_history.append(x.copy())
```

Visualize the results
=====================

x\_history = np.array(x\_history) time = np.arange(simulation\_time + 1) \* sampling\_time

plt.figure() plt.plot(time, x\_history, label='Temperature') plt.plot(time, setpoints \* np.ones\_like(time), '--', label='Setpoint') plt.xlabel('Time \[s\]') plt.ylabel('Temperature') plt.legend() plt.show()

This example demonstrates a basic NMPC optimization for a steam generator startup using a simplified non-linear model. You will need to adapt the model equations, cost function, and constraints to match the specific characteristics of the steam generator in your power plant. Additionally, you should consult with control engineers and power plant experts to ensure the controller's performance and safety.
