> Create a detailed startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine including typical parameter values.

Sure, here's a detailed startup sequence for the press section of a Valmet paper machine, along with some typical parameter values:

1.  Initial Preparation:

*   Check the hydraulic oil level and the cleanliness of the press section.
*   Ensure that the press rolls are in good condition and properly aligned.
*   Make sure the felts and wires are in good condition and properly threaded.

2.  Pre-Wetting Phase:

*   Pre-wet the press section with water to prevent any paper breaks.
*   Start the machine at a low speed (e.g. 200 m/min).
*   Set the nip pressure to a low value (e.g. 10 kN/m).
*   Set the press roll temperatures to a low value (e.g. 40°C).

3.  Felt Conditioning Phase:

*   Increase the machine speed (e.g. 500 m/min) and the nip pressure (e.g. 50 kN/m).
*   Condition the felts with a conditioning agent (e.g. soap) to improve their water retention capacity.
*   Increase the press roll temperatures (e.g. 70°C) to improve dewatering.

4.  First Pressing Phase:

*   Increase the machine speed (e.g. 800 m/min) and the nip pressure (e.g. 100 kN/m).
*   Set the press roll temperatures to the desired value for the paper grade being produced.
*   Adjust the felt tension and guiding to ensure proper paper guiding.
*   Monitor the paper web moisture content and adjust the nip pressure, felt tension, and guiding as necessary.

5.  Second Pressing Phase:

*   Increase the machine speed (e.g. 1200 m/min) and the nip pressure (e.g. 150 kN/m).
*   Continue to monitor the paper web moisture content and adjust the nip pressure, felt tension, and guiding as necessary.
*   Check for any paper defects, such as wrinkles, tears, or breaks, and take corrective action as necessary.

6.  Final Pressing Phase:

*   Increase the machine speed (e.g. 1500 m/min) and the nip pressure (e.g. 200 kN/m).
*   Continue to monitor the paper web moisture content and adjust the nip pressure, felt tension, and guiding as necessary.
*   Check for any remaining paper defects and take corrective action as necessary.

7.  Runout Phase:

*   Gradually decrease the machine speed and the nip pressure.
*   Run the machine at a low speed (e.g. 200 m/min) and rinse the press section with water to remove any remaining paper debris.
*   Shut down the press section and perform any necessary maintenance.

Typical parameter values for the press section of a Valmet paper machine can vary depending on the specific paper grade being produced, as well as other factors such as machine speed, felt type, and press roll design. However, some common parameter values are:

*   Nip pressure: 10-200 kN/m
*   Press roll temperatures: 40-100°C
*   Felt tension: 300-500 N/m
*   Felt guiding: 0.2-0.5 mm
*   Machine speed: 200-1500 m/min
*   Moisture content: 40-60%

> Write a self-contained IEC 61131-3 structured text program to control this startup sequence.

As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to write code in a specific environment. However, I can provide you with a general structured text program that could be used as a reference for implementing the startup sequence in IEC 61131-3.

Here's an example of a structured text program that controls the startup sequence of a Valmet paper machine press section:

    nip_pressure : REAL := 0.0;

    felt_guiding : REAL := 0.0;
    moisture_content : REAL := 0.0;
END_VAR

    // Start the machine at a low speed
    // Set the nip pressure to a low value
    // Set the press roll temperatures to a low value
    machine_speed := machine_speed + 50.0;
    nip_pressure := nip_pressure + 10.0;
    roll_temp := roll_temp + 2.0;
END_WHILE

// Felt Conditioning Phase

    // Increase the machine speed

    moisture_content := moisture_content + 5.0;
END_WHILE

    // Increase the machine speed
    // Adjust the felt tension and guiding

    machine_speed := machine_speed + 300.0;
    felt_tension := felt_tension + 50.0;
    felt_guiding := felt_guiding + 0.1;
    moisture_content := moisture_content + 5.0;
END_WHILE

// Final Pressing Phase
nip_pressure := 200.0;

WHILE moisture_content > 60.0 DO
    // Increase the machine speed
    // Adjust the felt tension and guiding
    // Monitor the paper web moisture content
    machine_speed := machine_speed + 300.0;
    felt_tension := felt_tension + 50.0;
    felt_guiding := felt_guiding + 0.1;
    moisture_content := moisture_content - 5.0;
END_WHILE

// Run
```

> continue

// Runout Phase WHILE machine\_speed > 200.0 DO // Gradually decrease the machine speed and the nip pressure // Run the machine at a low speed and rinse the press section with water machine\_speed := machine\_speed - 100.0; nip\_pressure := nip\_pressure - 50.0; END\_WHILE

```vbnet
This program uses variables to store the values of key parameters such as machine speed, nip pressure, press roll temperature, felt tension, felt guiding, and moisture content. It also uses while loops to gradually increase or decrease these parameters as the startup sequence progresses through its various phases. 

Note that this is just an example program, and the exact implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of the Valmet paper machine press section and the programming environment being used.
