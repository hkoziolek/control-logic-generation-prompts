> Write a 61131-3 structured text program to implement the interlocks of this distillation column. Provide concrete values for the high limits and low limits.

In this example, we'll implement a simple 61131-3 structured text program to control the safety interlocks of the distillation column described earlier. We'll use the following concrete values for the high limits and low limits:

*   Reflux Drum High Level: 90%
*   Reflux Drum Low Level: 10%
*   Reboiler High Level: 90%
*   Reboiler Low Level: 10%
*   Distillation Column High Pressure: 1200 kPa
*   Distillation Column Low Pressure: 300 kPa

Here is the structured text program:

METHOD UpdateInterlocks()
    (* Reflux Drum Level Interlocks *)
    LSH_101 := LT_101 >= 90;
    LSL_101 := LT_101 <= 10;

    (* Reboiler Level Interlocks *)
    LSH_102 := LT_102 >= 90;
    LSL_102 := LT_102 <= 10;

    (* Distillation Column Pressure Interlocks *)
    PSH_101 := PT_101 >= 1200;
    PSL_101 := PT_101 <= 300;
END_METHOD
END_PROGRAM
```

This structured text program defines variables for the level and pressure transmitters (LT\_101, LT\_102, and PT\_101) and the interlock switches (LSH\_101, LSL\_101, LSH\_102, LSL\_102, PSH\_101, and PSL\_101). The UpdateInterlocks() method updates the interlock switch states based on the current level and pressure readings.

In a real-world implementation, you would periodically call the UpdateInterlocks() method and integrate it with your control system to act on the interlock switch states, such as shutting down the process or triggering alarms.

> Extend the program with the actions that are performed when the interlocks are activated.

In this extension of the structured text program, we'll add actions to be performed when the interlocks are activated. These actions can include shutting down certain equipment, triggering alarms, or engaging emergency systems.

        Alarm := TRUE;

        Alarm := FALSE;
    END_IF;

    IF LSH_101 OR LSH_102 OR PSH_101 THEN

    END_IF;

    IF Shutdown THEN

    END_IF;
END_METHOD
END_PROGRAM
```

In this updated program, we've added a Shutdown flag and an Alarm flag. The UpdateInterlocks() method now sets these flags based on the state of the interlock switches. The PerformActions() method has been introduced to implement the actions that are performed when the interlocks are activated. In a real-world implementation, you would replace the comments in the PerformActions() method with the appropriate logic to handle alarms and shutdowns.

Periodically, you would call both the UpdateInterlocks() and PerformActions() methods to ensure that the interlocks are up-to-date, and the necessary actions are performed when the interlocks are activated.
