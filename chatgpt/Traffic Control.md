> Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program, not a function block, to control a traffic light system. The system shall react to pedestrian push buttons and to the presence of emergency vehicles to give them priority.

Here's a 61131-3 structured text program that controls a traffic light system. This program has three states: 'NormalOperation', 'Pedestrian' and 'Emergency'. The traffic light will react to pedestrian push buttons and give priority to emergency vehicles:

iecst

```iecst
PROGRAM TrafficLightControl
VAR
    State: (NormalOperation, Pedestrian, Emergency);
    GreenLight, YellowLight, RedLight: BOOL;
    PedestrianRequest, EmergencyVehicle: BOOL;
    NormalOperationTimer, PedestrianTimer, EmergencyTimer: TON;
    NormalOperationTime, PedestrianTime, EmergencyTime: TIME := T#0S;
END_VAR

State := NormalOperation;
NormalOperationTime := T#20S;
PedestrianTime := T#10S;
EmergencyTime := T#5S;

METHOD RunTrafficLightControl: BOOL
    PedestrianRequest := ReadPedestrianPushButton(); // Read pedestrian push button
    EmergencyVehicle := DetectEmergencyVehicle(); // Detect emergency vehicle

    CASE State OF
        NormalOperation:
            GreenLight := TRUE;
            YellowLight := FALSE;
            RedLight := FALSE;
            
            NormalOperationTimer(IN:= TRUE, PT:= NormalOperationTime);
            IF PedestrianRequest THEN
                State := Pedestrian;
                NormalOperationTimer(IN:= FALSE);
            ELSIF EmergencyVehicle THEN
                State := Emergency;
                NormalOperationTimer(IN:= FALSE);
            END_IF;

        Pedestrian:
            GreenLight := FALSE;
            YellowLight := TRUE;
            RedLight := FALSE;

            PedestrianTimer(IN:= TRUE, PT:= PedestrianTime);
            IF PedestrianTimer.Q THEN
                State := NormalOperation;
                PedestrianTimer(IN:= FALSE);
            END_IF;

        Emergency:
            GreenLight := FALSE;
            YellowLight := FALSE;
            RedLight := TRUE;

            EmergencyTimer(IN:= TRUE, PT:= EmergencyTime);
            IF EmergencyTimer.Q THEN
                State := NormalOperation;
                EmergencyTimer(IN:= FALSE);
            END_IF;

    END_CASE;
    
    SetTrafficLights(Green:= GreenLight, Yellow:= YellowLight, Red:= RedLight); // Set the traffic lights

    RETURN TRUE;
END_METHOD

END_PROGRAM
```

This program assumes that there are external functions to read the pedestrian push button, detect emergency vehicles, and set the traffic lights. You will need to implement or integrate these functions into your PLC system.

> The program does not switch to the red light in the pedestrian state, which prevents pedestrian from crossing. Moreover, in the emergency state the traffic light should switch to the green light to allow the emergency vehicle to pass. Please revise the program.

Apologies for the confusion. Here's the revised 61131-3 structured text program with the appropriate changes:

iecst

```iecst
PROGRAM TrafficLightControl
VAR
    State: (NormalOperation, Pedestrian, Emergency);
    GreenLight, YellowLight, RedLight: BOOL;
    PedestrianRequest, EmergencyVehicle: BOOL;
    NormalOperationTimer, PedestrianTimer, EmergencyTimer: TON;
    NormalOperationTime, PedestrianTime, EmergencyTime: TIME := T#0S;
END_VAR

State := NormalOperation;
NormalOperationTime := T#20S;
PedestrianTime := T#10S;
EmergencyTime := T#5S;

METHOD RunTrafficLightControl: BOOL
    PedestrianRequest := ReadPedestrianPushButton(); // Read pedestrian push button
    EmergencyVehicle := DetectEmergencyVehicle(); // Detect emergency vehicle

    CASE State OF
        NormalOperation:
            GreenLight := TRUE;
            YellowLight := FALSE;
            RedLight := FALSE;
            
            NormalOperationTimer(IN:= TRUE, PT:= NormalOperationTime);
            IF PedestrianRequest THEN
                State := Pedestrian;
                NormalOperationTimer(IN:= FALSE);
            ELSIF EmergencyVehicle THEN
                State := Emergency;
                NormalOperationTimer(IN:= FALSE);
            END_IF;

        Pedestrian:
            GreenLight := FALSE;
            YellowLight := FALSE;
            RedLight := TRUE;

            PedestrianTimer(IN:= TRUE, PT:= PedestrianTime);
            IF PedestrianTimer.Q THEN
                State := NormalOperation;
                PedestrianTimer(IN:= FALSE);
            END_IF;

        Emergency:
            GreenLight := TRUE;
            YellowLight := FALSE;
            RedLight := FALSE;

            EmergencyTimer(IN:= TRUE, PT:= EmergencyTime);
            IF EmergencyTimer.Q THEN
                State := NormalOperation;
                EmergencyTimer(IN:= FALSE);
            END_IF;

    END_CASE;
    
    SetTrafficLights(Green:= GreenLight, Yellow:= YellowLight, Red:= RedLight); // Set the traffic lights

    RETURN TRUE;
END_METHOD

END_PROGRAM
```

This updated program switches the traffic light to red in the 'Pedestrian' state, allowing pedestrians to cross safely. In the 'Emergency' state, the traffic light switches to green to let the emergency vehicles pass quickly.
