> Write a self-contained function block in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text to compute the eigenvalue of 10 by 10 matrix.

Calculating the eigenvalues of a 10x10 matrix in IEC 61131-3 Structured Text is a complex task that typically requires external libraries or additional functions for matrix operations. However, I can provide you with a function block that leverages the power iteration method to find the largest eigenvalue of a 10x10 matrix. The power iteration method is simple and easy to implement but has limitations. It only finds the largest eigenvalue, and its convergence can be slow for certain matrices. It also doesn't guarantee convergence for all matrices.

Here's the function block:

```iecst
FUNCTION_BLOCK LargestEigenvalue
VAR_INPUT
  Matrix: ARRAY[1..10, 1..10] OF REAL;
END_VAR

VAR_OUTPUT
  Eigenvalue: REAL;
END_VAR

VAR
  MaxIterations: INT := 1000;
  Tolerance: REAL := 1e-6;
  x: ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL;
  y: ARRAY[1..10] OF REAL;
  i, j, k: INT;
  norm_x, norm_y, ratio: REAL;
END_VAR

METHOD Calculate
  // Initialize x with all elements set to 1
  FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO
    x[i] := 1.0;
  END_FOR;

  FOR k := 1 TO MaxIterations DO
    // Calculate y = Matrix * x
    FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO
      y[i] := 0.0;
      FOR j := 1 TO 10 DO
        y[i] := y[i] + Matrix[i, j] * x[j];
      END_FOR;
    END_FOR;

    // Calculate the norms of x and y
```

norm_x := 0.0;
norm_y := 0.0;
FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO
  norm_x := norm_x + x[i] * x[i];
  norm_y := norm_y + y[i] * y[i];
END_FOR;
norm_x := SQRT(norm_x);
norm_y := SQRT(norm_y);

// Check for convergence
ratio := norm_y / norm_x;
IF ABS(Eigenvalue - ratio) < Tolerance THEN
  EXIT;
END_IF;
Eigenvalue := ratio;

// Normalize y and set x = y
FOR i := 1 TO 10 DO
  x[i] := y[i] / norm_y;
END_FOR;
```

```javascript
To use this function block in your PLC program, create an instance of the `LargestEigenvalue` function block, provide a 10x10 matrix as input, and call the `Calculate` method. The largest eigenvalue will be returned as output.

Please note that this implementation only finds the largest eigenvalue and is not suitable for finding all eigenvalues of a 10x10 matrix. Additionally, convergence is not guaranteed for all matrices.
