> Create an ISA-88c ontrol recipe of a batch production for aspirin known as acetylsalicylic acid. The physical structure consists of a reactor, a crystallizer, a centrifuge and a dryer. Educts are Acetic anhydride, Salicylic acid, and sulphuric acid as catalyst. Products are acetylsalicylic acid and acetic acid. Drying should happen at 90 째C.

ISA-88, also known as S88, is a standard for consistent terminologies and methodologies in batch control systems. It defines a hierarchical model for the organization of batch processes, including equipment, control recipes, and procedures. Below is an example of an ISA-88 compliant control recipe for the batch production of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid).

Please note that this is a simplified example of an ISA-88 compliant control recipe. Actual production parameters, such as temperature, pressure, and reaction times, should be determined based on specific process requirements and equipment capabilities. Additionally, this control recipe does not cover safety precautions, equipment cleaning procedures, or regulatory compliance.

> Write a self-contained 61131-3 structured text program for the sequential control of the reaction stage with typical parameter values.

The following example demonstrates a simplified IEC 61131-3 compliant Structured Text (ST) program for the sequential control of the reaction stage in the aspirin production process. The example assumes the use of a PLC for the control system.

```iecst
PROGRAM ReactionStage
VAR
    start_reaction: BOOL := FALSE;
    reaction_complete: BOOL := FALSE;
    reaction_time: TIME := T#30m; // 30 minutes, adjust as needed
    reaction_start_time: TIME;
    reaction_temperature: REAL := 90.0; // 90째C, adjust as needed
    reaction_pressure: REAL := 1.0; // 1 bar, adjust as needed

    current_time: TIME;
    current_temperature: REAL;
    current_pressure: REAL;
END_VAR

METHOD RunReaction()
    start_reaction := TRUE;
    reaction_start_time := CURRENT_TIME;

    WHILE NOT reaction_complete DO
        current_time := CURRENT_TIME;
        current_temperature := GetReactorTemperature();
        current_pressure := GetReactorPressure();

        IF (current_temperature < reaction_temperature) THEN
            HeatReactor();
        ELSIF (current_temperature > reaction_temperature) THEN
            CoolReactor();
        END_IF;

        IF (current_pressure < reaction_pressure) THEN
            IncreaseReactorPressure();
        ELSIF (current_pressure > reaction_pressure) THEN
            DecreaseReactorPressure();
        END_IF;

        IF (current_time - reaction_start_time) >= reaction_time THEN
            reaction_complete := TRUE;
        END_IF;
    END_WHILE;

    StopHeatingAndCooling();
    StopPressureControl();
    TransferToCrystallizer();
END_METHOD

// Placeholder methods for process control, replace with actual control functions
METHOD GetReactorTemperature(): REAL
    // Read temperature from sensor and return the value
    RETURN 0.0;
END_METHOD

METHOD GetReactorPressure(): REAL
    // Read pressure from sensor and return the value
    RETURN 0.0;
END_METHOD

METHOD HeatReactor()
    // Activate heating element or control valve for temperature increase
END_METHOD

METHOD CoolReactor()
    // Activate cooling system or control valve for temperature decrease
END_METHOD

METHOD IncreaseReactorPressure()
    // Activate pressure control valve to increase pressure
END_METHOD

METHOD DecreaseReactorPressure()
    // Activate pressure control valve to decrease pressure
END_METHOD

METHOD StopHeatingAndCooling()
    // Deactivate heating and cooling systems
END_METHOD

METHOD StopPressureControl()
    // Deactivate pressure control systems
END_METHOD

METHOD TransferToCrystallizer()
    // Transfer the reaction mixture to the crystallizer
END_METHOD
```

This example provides a basic framework for controlling the reaction stage in the aspirin production process using Structured Text. The actual implementation should be tailored to the specific hardware and control systems used. Additionally, safety precautions, error handling, and system interlocks should be included in the final program.
