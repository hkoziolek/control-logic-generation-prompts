Title: Control Narrative for Ammonium Nitrate Reactor

1.  Introduction This control narrative outlines the operational parameters, setpoints, and ranges for a reactor producing ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) through the neutralization reaction between ammonia (NH3) and nitric acid (HNO3). The primary goal is to maintain safe and efficient production while meeting quality specifications.
    
2.  Reactor Feed Control
    

2.1. Ammonia Feed Setpoint: 1,000 kg/h Range: 900-1,100 kg/h Control: Flow control valve (FCV) maintains the ammonia flow rate.

2.2. Nitric Acid Feed Setpoint: 1,300 kg/h Range: 1,170-1,430 kg/h Control: Flow control valve (FCV) maintains the nitric acid flow rate, ensuring a molar ratio of 1:1 for NH3 to HNO3.

3.  Reactor Temperature Control Setpoint: 180°C Range: 160-200°C Control: A temperature control loop, with a temperature transmitter (TT) and a temperature control valve (TCV), adjusts the cooling water flow to maintain the desired reactor temperature.
    
4.  Reactor Pressure Control Setpoint: 2 bar Range: 1.8-2.2 bar Control: A pressure control loop, with a pressure transmitter (PT) and a pressure control valve (PCV), adjusts the vent gas flow to maintain the desired reactor pressure.
    
5.  Product Concentration Control Setpoint: 95% ammonium nitrate Range: 93-97% Control: A concentration analyzer (CA) measures the product concentration, and the control system adjusts the ammonia and nitric acid flow rates to maintain the desired concentration.
    
6.  Reactor Level Control Setpoint: 50% of reactor volume Range: 45-55% Control: A level transmitter (LT) measures the reactor level, and the control system adjusts the product discharge flow rate to maintain the desired level.
    
7.  Safety Controls
    

7.1. High Temperature Alarm Setpoint: 210°C Action: If the reactor temperature exceeds the setpoint, an alarm will sound, and the control system will initiate emergency cooling measures.

7.2. High Pressure Alarm Setpoint: 2.5 bar Action: If the reactor pressure exceeds the setpoint, an alarm will sound, and the control system will initiate venting procedures to reduce pressure.

7.3. High-Level Alarm Setpoint: 60% of reactor volume Action: If the reactor level exceeds the setpoint, an alarm will sound, and the control system will reduce feed rates and increase product discharge to maintain the desired level.

8.  Data Logging and Reporting All process parameters, including flow rates, temperatures, pressures, and concentrations, are continuously monitored, logged, and reported to the control room for analysis and optimization. Any deviations from the setpoints and ranges will trigger an alarm, and corrective actions will be initiated accordingly.

9.  Emergency Shutdown Procedures In the event of an emergency, the reactor can be quickly shut down using the Emergency Shutdown (ESD) system. The ESD system is designed to shut off all feed and product flows, as well as cooling water and vent gas flows, and to isolate the reactor from other parts of the process.
    
10.  Maintenance and Calibration Procedures Regular maintenance and calibration of all control instruments, including transmitters, valves, and analyzers, are essential to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the control system. Maintenance and calibration procedures should be carried out as per the manufacturer's recommendations, and any deviations or malfunctions should be reported and rectified promptly.
    
11.  Conclusion The control narrative presented here outlines the setpoints, ranges, and control strategies for a reactor producing ammonium nitrate. The control system is designed to maintain safe and efficient production while meeting quality specifications. Effective monitoring, reporting, and maintenance procedures are essential to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the operation.
