75;Advanced Process Control;MPC Python Cellulose Fiber;"How can a model predictive control help in Cellulose fibers production from wood, where the infeed and outfeed must operate continuously while the material between undergoes a two-stage batch process?
Supplied at a average rate of 50 tons per hour, the material must first be pre-treated in a reactor and then homogenized before being transported into a 1,000 cubic meter tank. The preliminary product is not taken from this buffer tank at a constant rate, but rather on demand. To minimize the risk of downtime in downstream stations, a constantly high fill level must be maintained. Due to the duration of the upstream batch processes, however, it takes around two hours to react to a fluctuations in demand. This dead time ruled out the use of a PID controller to automate flow rate adjustments.
