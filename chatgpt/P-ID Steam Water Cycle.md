The steam water cycle starts with the boiler (B-101) generating steam, which flows through the piping (P-102) to the steam turbine (ST-101). The steam turbine converts the steam's energy into mechanical work, and the exhaust steam is sent through the piping (P-103) to the condenser (C-101). The condenser cools the steam into condensate, which is then pumped by the feedwater pump (FP-101) through the piping (P-104) and (P-105) to the feedwater heater (H-101). Finally, the preheated feedwater returns to the boiler (B-101) through the piping (P-101), completing the cycle

6.  Feedwater Heater Level Control (Instrument tag: LIC-103) a. Level Transmitter (Instrument tag: LT-103) b. Level Indicator (Instrument tag: LI-103) c. Level Controller (Instrument tag: LC-103) d. Control Valve (Instrument tag: LV-103)

After the feedwater heater (H-101), the preheated feedwater flows back to the boiler (B-101), which produces steam to continue the cycle. The boiler drum level is maintained by LIC-101, which controls the feedwater inflow through the control valve LV-101. Steam pressure is managed by PIC-101, regulating the steam flow through control valve PV-101. Similarly, steam temperature is controlled by TIC-101 using control valve TV-101.

In the condenser, LIC-102 ensures proper condensate levels by controlling the condensate outflow through the control valve LV-102. The condenser pressure is maintained by PIC-102, which manages the cooling water flow through control valve PV-102.

The feedwater heater level is controlled by LIC-103, which manages the feedwater outflow through control valve LV-103. The steam turbine speed is regulated by SIC-101, which controls the steam flow through the turbine governor valve SV-101.

These control loops work together to ensure the optimal operation of the steam water cycle in the power plant, maximizing efficiency and maintaining safe operating conditions.
